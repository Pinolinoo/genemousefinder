# genemousefinder
Package made to find specific Gene in La Manno (2021) Mouse Brain Data.

It outputs a graph for the total number of counts in the dataset of the specified gene per age, as well as a heatmap for the number of counts per cell-class per age. 

To use it open the "GeneFinderMouseData.ipynb" with jupyter notebook and enter your gene name of interest. 
In order for it to work you need the Mouse Data of this paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03775-x#data-availability which can be found here: http://mousebrain.org/downloads.html. 
The file we need is called "dev_all.agg.loom" and needs to be placed inside the working directory.
